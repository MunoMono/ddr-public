## Systems
Card slots are ready for charts or short callouts once live data is available.

- **Collection health** — 86% of the collection has aligned descriptors. Placeholder metric until APIs are wired up.
- **People** — 12 partner collectives participate in the public programme this quarter.
- **Stories shipped** — four narrative prototypes published, two in review. Placeholder tag remains until data connects.

## Metrics
Progress visualisations can be swapped in for the bars below.

- Semantic alignment — 72% progress.
- Access requests — 54% progress.
- Weekly updates — 32% progress.

## Next up
What ships next? Tabs in the original UI showcased how you might stage future insight summaries or embed Carbon charts. Use the prompts below as stand-ins until your own analytics are ready.

- **Signals** — track qualitative signals that bubble up from rehearsals and interviews. Replace this block with Carbon charts or tables later.
- **Models** — drop diagrams, causal loops, or simplified system dynamics models here. Tabs mirror the Carbon system used across the shell.
- **Feedback** — threaded partner feedback will live here to keep reviews public.
