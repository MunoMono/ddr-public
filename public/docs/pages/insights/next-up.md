What ships next? Tabs in the original UI showcased how you might stage future insight summaries or embed Carbon charts. Use the prompts below as stand-ins until your own analytics are ready.

- **Signals** — track qualitative signals that bubble up from rehearsals and interviews. Replace this block with Carbon charts or tables later.
- **Models** — drop diagrams, causal loops, or simplified system dynamics models here. Tabs mirror the Carbon system used across the shell.
- **Feedback** — threaded partner feedback will live here to keep reviews public.
