## Public workstreams
Each stream corresponds to a full section inside the parent repo. Swap the placeholder copy with live copy decks, attach data visualisations, or connect to a headless CMS.

- **Taxonomy refresh** — surface the vocabulary that underpins the collection so contributors can align language.
- **Model lab** — demonstrate how systems modelling is translated into public stories and prototypes.
- **Story bank** — publish selected qualitative notes that can be cited by collaborators.
