## Overview
Partners asked to see the scaffolding that shapes DDR's internal work. This view keeps sensitive research inside the parent application while still exposing the information architecture, typography, and pacing.

- **Mirrors internal IA** — carries the navigation and spacing tokens from the research application so external collaborators build context quickly.
- **Safe to publish** — only structural copy ships in this drop. Swap in your own data or decks without exposing internal models.
- **Fast to iterate** — Vite plus Carbon means future drops compile fast and inherit IBM's accessibility baseline.
