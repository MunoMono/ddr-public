## Roadmap
The tabs from the parent interface reappear here so you can preview how content might be staged as it grows.

### Context
*What is this drop?*  
Internal structure, public shell. The ddr-public build mirrors the navigation and content hierarchy of the internal "phd research" application. Each page is intentionally sparse so you can attach your own content or data extracts later.

### Audience
*Why surface it?*  
Designed for external partners. Partners repeatedly asked to see the tooling that shapes our research programmes. This preview gives them an anchor while sensitive data stays inside the parent environment.

### Next
*What comes next?*  
Extended documentation. Future drops will include API documentation, richer glossary entries, and safe-to-share metrics. The structure is already in place so those assets can slide in with minimal work.
