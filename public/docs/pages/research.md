## Workflow
The public track mirrors the internal flow: scope questions with researchers, stage placeholder content, and only then open the door to partners.

- **Intake** — define the public questions to explore before duplicating any sensitive workflows or datasets.
- **Experimentation** — spin up sandbox components on this shell (charts, cards, short decks) to test storytelling approaches.
- **Release** — replace placeholder text, update anchors, and publish static builds after research owners sign off.

## Dataset overview
Tabs, tables, and accordions ship as placeholders. Use Carbon components to slot in data extracts or API responses when they become available.

- **Qualitative** — interview fragments, rehearsal notes, and reflective journals staged for qualitative coding.
- **Quantitative** — structured exports that summarise rehearsal durations, participation, and metadata health.
- **Models** — system dynamics and knowledge graphs published as simplified diagrams for public review.

| Dataset | Cadence | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Field notes | Weekly | DDR Core | Redacted |
| Catalogue | Monthly | Archive Guild | In sync |
| Systems lab | Ad hoc | Model team | Snapshots |

## Collaboration model
Each partner collective mirrors the same cadence so decisions stay transparent.

- DDR Core
- Archive Guild
- Partner collectives
- Model team

Replace these placeholders with your own partner briefs, API references, or design reviews when you are ready to ship public programme notes.
