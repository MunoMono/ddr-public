## Overview
Partners asked to see the scaffolding that shapes DDR's internal work. This view keeps sensitive research inside the parent application while still exposing the information architecture, typography, and pacing.

- **Mirrors internal IA** — carries the navigation and spacing tokens from the research application so external collaborators build context quickly.
- **Safe to publish** — only structural copy ships in this drop. Swap in your own data or decks without exposing internal models.
- **Fast to iterate** — Vite plus Carbon means future drops compile fast and inherit IBM's accessibility baseline.

## Public workstreams
Each stream corresponds to a full section inside the parent repo. Swap the placeholder copy with live copy decks, attach data visualisations, or connect to a headless CMS.

- **Taxonomy refresh** — surface the vocabulary that underpins the collection so contributors can align language.
- **Model lab** — demonstrate how systems modelling is translated into public stories and prototypes.
- **Story bank** — publish selected qualitative notes that can be cited by collaborators.

## Roadmap
The tabs from the parent interface reappear here so you can preview how content might be staged as it grows.

### Context
*What is this drop?*  
Internal structure, public shell. The ddr-public build mirrors the navigation and content hierarchy of the internal "phd research" application. Each page is intentionally sparse so you can attach your own content or data extracts later.

### Audience
*Why surface it?*  
Designed for external partners. Partners repeatedly asked to see the tooling that shapes our research programmes. This preview gives them an anchor while sensitive data stays inside the parent environment.

### Next
*What comes next?*  
Extended documentation. Future drops will include API documentation, richer glossary entries, and safe-to-share metrics. The structure is already in place so those assets can slide in with minimal work.
