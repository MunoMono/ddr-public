## Workflow
The public track mirrors the internal flow: scope questions with researchers, stage placeholder content, and only then open the door to partners.

- **Intake** — define the public questions to explore before duplicating any sensitive workflows or datasets.
- **Experimentation** — spin up sandbox components on this shell (charts, cards, short decks) to test storytelling approaches.
- **Release** — replace placeholder text, update anchors, and publish static builds after research owners sign off.
