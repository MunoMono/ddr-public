# Contact the DDR ingestion platform team

Need help with a workflow, have a question about a record, or spotted something that does not look right? Use the channels below to reach the right member of the team.

## Support requests
- **General enquiries** – reach the DDR ingestion support inbox or post in the #ddr-ingestion Slack channel with the PID, record name, and a short summary of the issue.
- **Media problems** – message the media ops channel in Slack and include the file identifier so we can trace the upload.
- **Access management** – raise a request in Jira using the "Access" template or notify the platform admins during business hours.

## Incident or outage
If the platform is unavailable or an ingestion job is blocked, raise an incident in the shared Slack channel and phone the on-call contact listed in the runbook. Include screenshots, timestamps, and any error IDs from the UI when possible.

## Feedback and roadmap ideas
We welcome suggestions about new features or documentation gaps. Share ideas in the monthly working group or send them to the roadmap mailbox so they can be triaged for the next release.
